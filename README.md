In the beginning, my purpose is for the expanding recycler view. For it, I need to make recycler
view adapt to each of the type of the list children. For this reason, first I open this adaptive
recycler view.

This adaptive recycler view might be not the easiest way to achieve. I'm using the concept of [Visitor
Pattern](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Visitor_pattern) into this adaptive recycler view. Here there're
some roles I have to introduce first.

- **_Visitor_**: `AdaptiveAdapter`
- **_Visitable (Element)_**: `IVisitable`

We use them to get each of the type of the elements.

# How to use

#### First create concrete class

1. **RecyclerView.Adaptor**
2. **ViewHolder**
3. **Data Model Elements**
4. **ViewTypeFactory**

#### üç∑ Example

Make two type of the element class.

```kotlin
data class ProductTypeOne(var name: String,
                          override var childItemList: List<IExpandVisitor> = emptyList(),
                          override var isExpandable: Boolean = false): IVisitable {
    override fun type(typeFactory: MultiTypeFactory): Int = typeFactory.type(this)
}

data class ProductTypeTwo(var name: String,
                          override var childItemList: List<IExpandVisitor> = emptyList(),
                          override var isExpandable: Boolean = false): IVisitable {
    override fun type(typeFactory: MultiTypeFactory): Int = typeFactory.type(this)
}
```

Create a multiple view type factory for providing difference view type and view holder.

```kotlin
class MultiTypeFactory: ViewTypeFactory() {
 override var transformMap: MutableMap<Int, Pair<Int, (View) -> ViewHolder>> =
     mutableMapOf(1 to Pair(R.layout.item_first ) { itemView -> FirstViewHolder(itemView) },
         2 to Pair(R.layout.item_second ) { itemView -> SecondViewHolder(itemView) })

 fun type(typeone: ProductTypeOne): Int = 1

 fun type(typetwo: ProductTypeTwo): Int = 2
}
```

Depend on the difference layouts, we init in each of view holder. The view holder is like an
`activity`/`fragment`. I prefer to initial and control the components in the view holder.

```kotlin
class TypeOneViewHolder(view: View): AdaptiveViewHolder<MultiTypeFactory, ProductTypeOne>(view) {
    override fun initView(model: ProductTypeOne, position: Int, adapter: Any) {
        adapter as YouAdapterClassName
    }
}

class TypeTwoViewHolder(view: View): AdaptiveViewHolder<MultiTypeFactory, ProductTypeTwo>(view) {
    override fun initView(model: ProductTypeTwo, position: Int, adapter: Any) {
        adapter as YouAdapterClassName
    }
}
```

As like original using, it's so easy!

```kotlin
class MainActivity: AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        ...
        val itemList: MutableList<IVisitable> =
            mutableListOf(ProductTypeTwo("iPhone 6 plus"),
                ProductTypeOne("Google"),
                ProductTypeOne("HTC"),
                ProductTypeTwo("iPhone 6"),
                ProductTypeTwo("iPhone 6s"),
                ProductTypeTwo("iPhone 7"),
                ProductTypeTwo("iPhone 6s"),
                ProductTypeOne("Mi"),
                ProductTypeOne("Facebook"))

        recyclerView.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(this, LinearLayoutManager.VERTICAL, false)
        recyclerView.adapter = AdaptiveAdapter(itemList)
    }
}
```

If you'd like to know more detail or how to implement the expanding recycler view, check the sample project
please. There is a simple sample for this library. üòÑ

## Gradle

It's very easy to import, you just put them into your gradle file.

```gradle
compile "com.devrapid.jieyi:adaptiverecyclerview:1.0.6"
```

## Maven

```maven
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.devrapid.jieyi</groupId>
  <artifactId>adaptiverecyclerview</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.5</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

# Feature

- [ ] Reduce the inherit classe.
- [ ] The `adapter` parameter in the `AdaptiveViewHolder` to specific data type.

If you have any idea about making this library better, please give me an issue.
Thank you very much!
